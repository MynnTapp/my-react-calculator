## Overview

The React Calculator project is a functional calculator app that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations, like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It includes logic to handle consecutive operator inputs intelligently, using only the last operator entered in any sequence, while still displaying all entered operators in the input.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Consecutive Operator Handling**: Ignores consecutive operators in calculations, only applying the last operator in a sequence.
- **Responsive Design**: Compatible with various screen sizes for ease of use on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Clear and Reset Functionality**: Easily clear the current input or reset all calculations.
- **Evaluation on Enter**: Calculates the result when the user presses `=`.
